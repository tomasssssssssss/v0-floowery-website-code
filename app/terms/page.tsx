          <p className="mb-4">
            Welcome to Floowery. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to comply with and be legally
            bound by the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our
            services.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Service Description</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Floowery provides a promotional service designed to help users grow their Instagram following by connecting
            them with real, active Instagram users. We do not use bots, fake accounts, or engagement pods. All followers
            delivered through our service are real people with active Instagram accounts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. How It Works</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Floowery operates through a network of over 2,000 niche Instagram pages across various industries. We run
            targeted ads and promotions for your profile through these pages, exposing your account to users who are
            likely to be interested in your content.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">Our process:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>You provide your Instagram username (no password required).</li>
            <li>We analyze your account and identify relevant promotional pages.</li>
            <li>Your profile is promoted through strategic placements.</li>
            <li>Interested users discover and follow your account.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This ensures organic growth with real users who are more likely to engage with your content.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Account Registration</h2>

            <li>Keep your account information updated.</li>

            activities.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Results Disclaimer</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Floowery does not guarantee specific engagement metrics (likes, comments, etc.). While we aim to deliver
            high-quality followers, actual engagement levels may vary based on your content, niche, and posting
            frequency.
          </p>
